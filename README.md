## Background

Motion detection is a fundamental concept in computer vision, widely used in security systems, surveillance, robotics, and more. This project was created as part of an online OpenCV course to help you learn and apply motion detection techniques effectively.

## Features

- Supports multiple background subtraction types: 'GMG', 'MOG2', 'MOG', 'KNN', 'CNT'.
- Offers filter options for post-processing: closing, dilation, opening, and combinations of these filters.

## Background_Subtractors

- Five background subtraction types: 'GMG', 'MOG2', 'MOG', 'KNN', 'CNT'.
